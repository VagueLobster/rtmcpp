# rtm++

This is a (*relatively*) thin wrapper around [Realtime Math](https://github.com/nfrechette/rtm) that adds a more C++ style API.

The primary goal of rtm++ is to provide a more convenient API compared to rtm, more akin to [glm](https://github.com/g-truc/glm), including C++ operator overloads for the vector math types.
